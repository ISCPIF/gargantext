# Gargantext Installation

## OS

## Debian Stretch
See install/debian

If you do not have a Debian environment, then install docker and 
execute /srv/gargantext/install/docker/dev/install.sh

You need a docker image.
All the steps are explained in docker/dev/install.sh (not automatic yet).

Bug reports are welcome.
